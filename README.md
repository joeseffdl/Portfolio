# Explore Zeph's Online Portfolio 👀
Hello, World! 👋 I’m excited to share my online portfolio with you.
<br>

It offers a detailed view of my skills and experience in 🕸️ web development, featuring a range of projects that highlight both my professional work and personal projects.

Since there is nothing much to see on my GitHub account aside from 🍝 spaghetti  code...😅 I encourage you to explore my portfolio on [Vercel](https://zeph.vercel.app/ "Joseph De Leon's Portfolio") 🎉 to see the quality and creativity I bring to my work.

## Technology Stack that I used 🧑‍💻
This portfolio project was built using the following **modern technologies**.
1. [`ReactJS`](https://react.dev/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces with a component-based architecture
2. [`NextJS`](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework built on React that enhances it with server-side rendering and static site generation for improved performance and SEO.
3. [`Tailwind CSS`](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of low-level utility classes for building custom designs directly in your HTML.

## Idea Behind the Design 🖊️
The idea behind my online portfolio is to create an elegant and engaging experience through a minimalist design that integrates scroll-based interactions and subtle animations. This approach ensures a smooth and intuitive user journey while maintaining a clean and uncluttered aesthetic.

The minimalist design serves as a foundation for clarity and focus, allowing content to take center stage without unnecessary distractions. As users scroll through the portfolio, seamless transitions and gentle animations bring each section to life, enhancing the storytelling without overwhelming the viewer.

By harmonizing simplicity with dynamic elements, the design not only offers a visually appealing experience but also ensures efficient navigation and interaction. This balance of minimalism with innovative scroll-based features and animations creates a polished, professional presentation that highlights both creativity and technical skill.
